📊 Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning & EDA

This project focuses on performing Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables and identify meaningful trends that influenced passenger survival.

🔍 Project Overview

Loaded and inspected the dataset

Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked

Converted important columns to appropriate data types

Explored numerical relationships with a correlation heatmap

Visualized key patterns through plots such as:

Survival count

Survival by gender

Survival by passenger class

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📁 Dataset

Titanic Dataset used from Kaggle (CSV format).
Titanic-Dataset.csv

📈 Key Insights

Females had a higher chance of survival

Passengers in higher classes (1st class) survived more

Younger passengers had better survival odds

Strong correlations observed between Pclass, Fare, and Survival

Age distribution

Identified insights related to survival trends
